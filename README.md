# AWS Source Plugin
Forked from: https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/tree/fdce62ae6a5a808bd98dedef089f853528010a24/plugins/source/aws

Altered for OpsHelmInc Specific Use

The AWS Source plugin extracts information from many of the supported services by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## When making a change....

Some of the files are autogenerated by `/codegen/` ... and `/codegen/` is built using information from the repo.  So once you have made the changes you want to make, you need to do the following before running any builds or unit tests:

```bash
$ cd codegen
$ go build
$ ./codegen
```
